BtZ is a zero-based budget system to help you get your finances on track and stop living paycheck to paycheck, or just increase your awareness if you've already broken the paycheck to paycheck cycle.

The intent is to use the following technologies for educational purposes, though they are subject to change at any time:
- Vue
- vue-router
- vuex
- D3

Can I register the components with only the data they need? (if there's ever data they don't need)


Should each transaction row be a component? Can it?
